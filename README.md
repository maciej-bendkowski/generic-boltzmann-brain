# generic-boltzmann-brain

*Generic-boltzmann-brain* is a framework which allows one to automatically
derive multiparametric *analytic* (Boltzmann) samplers for algebraic data types
in Haskell. As such, *generic-boltzmann-brain* is a twin project of
[Boltzmann-brain](https://github.com/maciej-bendkowski/boltzmann-brain).

Please bear in mind that the current project is still under active development.
Usage instractions, documentation, and tooling will be delivered in the near future.
In the meantime, you're welcome to explore the current codebase for yourself.
